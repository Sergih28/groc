# Use automatic or manual translations

## Context and Problem Statement

- **How can we automate translations effectively?**
  Exploring methods to automate translations efficiently for broader language
  accessibility.

- **What's the aim regarding audience reach and translations?**
  Seeking a solution to reach a larger audience without being dependent solely
  on manual translations.

## Considered Options

- Automatic translation library (react-auto-translate)
- Manual translations (DeepL and ChatGPT)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option "Manual translations", because limited options and dependencies on
external services or API keys hindered this approach. Thus, leveraging DeepL
and ChatGPT for manual translations emerged as the preferred method, ensuring
control over the localization process without relying on external dependencies.
