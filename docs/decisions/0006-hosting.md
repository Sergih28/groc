# Decision: Hosting Platform - GitHub Pages vs. Vercel

## Context and Problem Statement

- **What's the aim in terms of hosting selection for our website?**

To identify the best hosting platform that aligns with our website's simplicity
and minimal JavaScript, allowing seamless integration with Git repositories and
cost-free setup for the initial deployment.

## Considered Options

- GitHub Pages
- Vercel

## Decision Outcome

GitHub Pages offers easy setup, free hosting, and smooth Git integration. It's
perfect for simple static sites with basic JavaScript, providing a hassle-free
environment for hosting without limitations. While Vercel has wider language and
framework support, GitHub Pages' user-friendliness and compatibility with
straightforward static sites make it a solid option for initial hosting.
