# Decision: Date Library Selection 

## Context and Problem Statement

- **What's the purpose of this decision?**

Choosing the most suitable date library among Day.js, Date-fns, and Moment.js 
for integration into our project's codebase.

- **What factors influence this decision?**

Considerations include size, functionality, modularity, and alignment with 
project goals while selecting a suitable date library.

## Considered Options

- Day.js
  - Small size, modular architecture, minimalist API
- Date-fns
  - Over 200 functions, modularity, TypeScript compatibility
- Moment.js
  - Comprehensive, widely used, heavier in size

## Decision Outcome

After careful consideration, Day.js emerged as the optimal choice. Its modular 
structure and minimalist API align perfectly with our 
project's focus on avoiding unnecessary bloat while prioritizing essential 
features.
