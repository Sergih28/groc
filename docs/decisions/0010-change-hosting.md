# Decision: Transition from Github Pages to Vercel

## Context and Problem Statement

Adjust hosting platform based on the decision to switch from GitHub Pages to
Vercel, considering the need for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in our website.

## Considered Options

- Vercel

## Decision Outcome

Transitioning hosting to Vercel due to GitHub Pages' SSR limitation. Vercel's
broader support meets specific requirements, providing enhanced flexibility
for our website's functionality.
